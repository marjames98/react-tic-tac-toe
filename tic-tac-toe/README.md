# React Tic Tac Toe

For **SEI 1019** this is a week-long deliverable, **due Monday, Decemeber 14**.

Follow the [React tic tac toe tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)!

You'll notice there are two options for setup that the tutorial offers. Do **Setup Option 2: Local Development Environment**. Make the project a github repo and commit as you go.

## How to submit:

* Fork & clone this repository
* Add to this `readme.md`below!
* Pull request :D 

## Paste the link to your finished repo here:


## Write a brief `reflection` on what you learned from this tutorial here:

* A lot about functions that I wasn't understanding in Unit One
* Creating buttons and how to make them do stuff (lots of googling)
* Styling styling styling! One of my favorite things to do now is play around with the style code to see if I can get things to look how I see them in my head, on screen. The more I do the same thing over and over (and cheat by looking back at my previous repos), the more that constant repetition becomes embedded information in my brain.
